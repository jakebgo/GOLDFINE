# Creative Builder Portfolio Website Project Plan

## Background and Motivation
This project aims to create a minimalist, visually striking portfolio website that effectively demonstrates the combination of creative vision and technical execution. The goal is to establish a personal brand as a "Creative Builder" - someone who balances technical and creative skills. The website itself will serve as the primary demonstration of this duality, showcasing technical skill through interactive elements while maintaining a strong aesthetic derived from minimalist principles, inspired by sites like rauno.me.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. **Technical-Creative Balance**: The core challenge is creating a website that effectively demonstrates both technical proficiency and creative design sensibilities. This requires careful implementation of interactive elements that are both visually appealing and technically impressive.

2. **Performance**: The interactive elements, particularly the Canvas-based background, must maintain high performance (60+ fps) to create a smooth user experience.

3. **Minimalist Design vs Functionality**: Balancing the minimalist aesthetic with sufficient functionality and content to effectively communicate the portfolio information.

4. **Technical Implementation**: Implementing the interactive background with Canvas API and the floating portfolio element with Motion One library requires careful planning and execution.

5. **Browser Compatibility**: Ensuring the website functions correctly across major desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) while maintaining performance.

   - Create containers for interactive elements with appropriate id/class attributes
   - Use clear, semantic class naming (following kebab-case per architecture.md)
   - *Success Criteria*: HTML structure matches the architectural design with semantic elements and proper container hierarchy

5. **Apply Basic CSS Styling and Typography**
   - Implement CSS variables for consistent styling:
     ```css
     :root {
       /* Colors */
       --primary-color: #...;
       --secondary-color: #...;
       --background-color: #...;
       --text-color: #...;
       
       /* Typography */
       --heading-font: '...', sans-serif;
       --body-font: '...', sans-serif;
       
       /* Spacing */
       --spacing-sm: ...px;
       --spacing-md: ...px;
       --spacing-lg: ...px;
     }
     ```
   - Set up typography for the main "GOLDFINE" text (large, bold, visually striking)
   - Apply base styles using Flexbox/Grid for layout
   - Position elements according to design (navigation/contact fixed to bottom-center per architecture.md)
   - Style the main content sections for proper visual hierarchy
   - *Success Criteria*: Page displays with proper layout and typography, matching minimalist aesthetic

6. **Add "About Me" and Contact Content**
   - Add brief "About Me" summary text conveying the "creative builder" brand identity
   - Add contact links:
     - Email link using `mailto:` protocol
     - X/Twitter link using direct URL
   - Style content appropriately using the CSS variables defined in task 5
   - Position the navigation/contact fixed to the bottom-center of the viewport per architecture.md
   - *Success Criteria*: About section and contact links are visible, properly styled, and functional (links work when clicked)

### Epic 2: Interactive Background Implementation
7. **Canvas Setup and Basic Grid Drawing**
   - Set up canvas element to fill viewport with appropriate sizing
   - Get 2D rendering context in JavaScript:
     ```javascript
     const canvas = document.getElementById('background-canvas');
     const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
     ```
   - Implement window resize handler to maintain full viewport canvas
   - Create function to draw a basic perspective grid (per architecture.md: lines changing color on mouse hover/proximity)
   - Set up initial grid parameters (number of lines, spacing, etc.)
   - Implement clear canvas and grid drawing functionality
   - *Success Criteria*: Static grid displays properly on canvas at all viewport sizes, and the drawing approach follows clear function patterns per coding standards (Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide)

8. **Implement Mouse Interaction for Canvas**
   - Add mouse event listeners for tracking position:
     ```javascript
     document.addEventListener('mousemove', handleMouseMove);
     ```
   - Create mouse position tracking with proper coordinate mapping to canvas
   - Update grid drawing based on mouse position (lines should change color on proximity)
   - Implement color transition effect (lines change color on hover/proximity and fade back)
   - Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth rendering:
     ```javascript
     function animate() {
       // Clear canvas and redraw grid with current mouse position
       requestAnimationFrame(animate);
     }
     ```
   - Ensure performance optimization for smooth 60+ fps animation
   - *Success Criteria*: Grid reacts smoothly to mouse movement with color change effects, maintaining 60+ fps, and following the specific interaction pattern described in architecture.md

### Epic 3: Featured Portfolio Element
9. **Create and Style Portfolio Element**
   - Create HTML element for the featured project with appropriate markup
   - Style element with CSS for visual appeal:
     - Use subtle box-shadow for depth
     - Apply appropriate sizing and positioning
     - Create visually distinct appearance using CSS variables
   - Add hover effects using CSS transitions:
     ```css
     .portfolio-element {
       transition: transform 0.3s ease, box-shadow 0.3s ease;
     }
     .portfolio-element:hover {
       transform: scale(1.05);
       box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
     }
     ```
   - Ensure element is properly positioned in the layout
   - *Success Criteria*: Portfolio element displays with proper styling and hover effects, following the minimalist aesthetic while being visually distinct

10. **Implement Floating Movement Effect**
    - Add Motion One library to the project:
      ```html
      <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/motion@10.16.2/dist/motion.min.js"></script>
      ```
    - Implement subtle floating/parallax effect based on mouse position:
      ```javascript
      // Example pseudocode using Motion One
      const portfolioElement = document.querySelector('.portfolio-element');
      document.addEventListener('mousemove', (e) => {
        // Calculate movement based on mouse position
        // Apply movement using Motion One
      });
      ```
    - Limit movement range to keep effect subtle
    - Ensure effect is performant by optimizing calculations and minimizing repaints
    - Add damping/smoothing to movement for natural feel
    - *Success Criteria*: Portfolio element moves smoothly in response to mouse position with subtle, natural-feeling parallax effect, maintaining performance standards

### Epic 4: Project Detail Display
11. **Implement Project Detail Modal**
    - Create HTML structure for modal overlay:
      ```html
      <div class="modal-overlay">
        <div class="modal-content">
          <button class="modal-close">×</button>
          <h2 class="project-title"></h2>
          <div class="project-description"></div>
          <img class="project-thumbnail" src="" alt="">
          <video class="project-video" controls></video>
        </div>
      </div>
      ```
    - Style modal with CSS:
      - Full-screen overlay with semi-transparent background
      - Centered content box with appropriate padding/margins
      - Styling for title, description, media elements
      - Animation for appearing/disappearing
    - Add close button and style appropriately
    - Initially hide modal using `display: none`
    - *Success Criteria*: Modal structure exists with proper styling, is hidden by default, and includes all necessary elements for project content (title, description, thumbnail, video) as specified in architecture.md

12. **Connect Portfolio Element to Modal**
    - Add click event listener to portfolio element:
      ```javascript
      document.querySelector('.portfolio-element').addEventListener('click', showProjectDetails);
      ```
    - Create function to populate modal with project details from hardcoded data:
      ```javascript
      const projectData = {
        "title": "Project Title",
        "description": "Project description text goes here...",
        "thumbnailUrl": "assets/images/project-thumbnail.jpg",
        "videoUrl": "assets/videos/project-video.mp4"
      };
      ```
    - Implement show/hide functionality for modal
    - Add event listeners for closing modal (close button, background click, ESC key)
    - Ensure smooth transitions for showing/hiding
    - *Success Criteria*: Clicking portfolio element shows modal with complete project details, and modal can be closed via multiple methods (button, background click, ESC key)
