Architecture for Creative Builder Portfolio Website
Status: Approved

Technical Summary
This document outlines the architectural blueprint for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the Creative Builder personal portfolio website. The primary objective is to deliver a minimalist, performant, and visually engaging online presence that effectively showcases the blend of creative and technical skills. The architecture centers around a static website served directly to the client's browser, leveraging core web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for structure, styling, and dynamic interactivity. Key interactive features, including a mouse-reactive canvas background and a floating portfolio element, will be implemented using modern JavaScript and the lightweight animation library Motion One to ensure smooth performance and contribute to the unique brand identity. The site will present a single featured project with detailed information, accessible via a modal interface, along with essential "About Me" and contact information.

Technology Table
Technology	Version	Description
HTML5	-	Standard markup language for structuring web content. Semantic elements will be prioritized.
CSS3	-	Standard stylesheet language for styling web content. CSS Variables and Flexbox/Grid will be used for layout.

Note: Specific version of Motion One will be pinned upon project initialization.

High-Level Overview
The architecture for the Creative Builder Portfolio MVP is a Static Website served directly to the client browser. This approach is chosen because:

The content is largely static for the MVP (hardcoded project details, about text).
Performance is critical, and serving static assets is highly efficient.
Client-side JavaScript handles all interactivity and dynamic rendering (Canvas, DOM manipulation).
Complexity is minimized, aligning with the MVP goal.
This architecture is simple, robust, and easily deployable to various static hosting platforms.

Component View
The website, while architecturally static at the high level, can be logically broken down into several key client-side components or modules responsible for specific parts of the experience.

        browser -- "Renders and Executes" --> website_components

    Container_Boundary(website_components, "Website Client-Side")
Component Responsibilities:

Main Layout & Structure: The foundational HTML document (index.html) and primary CSS (style.css) responsible for setting up the viewport, defining the major sections (landing, about, contact), applying base styles, typography, and layout using Flexbox/Grid.
Interactive Background (Canvas): Manages the <canvas> element. Uses the Canvas 2D API to draw the perspective grid. Implements mouse event listeners to track position and update the grid drawing logic to create the color-changing interactive effect based on mouse proximity. Utilizes requestAnimationFrame for smooth rendering.
Featured Portfolio Element: The HTML element representing the single project. Styled with CSS for visual appearance and hover effects. Uses JavaScript and Motion One for the subtle mouse-reactive floating/parallax effect. Listens for click events to trigger the display of the Project Detail Modal.
Project Detail Modal: The HTML structure for the overlay/modal. Styled with CSS to be centered and cover the screen when active. JavaScript manages its visibility (display: none vs. active state). JavaScript populates the modal content (Title, Description, Image, Video) from a hardcoded source when triggered. Contains a close button and potentially an overlay click listener to hide itself.
Navigation & Contact: The HTML elements for the "About Me" summary and contact links (Email, X). Styled with CSS and positioned fixed in the bottom-center of the viewport. JavaScript may be used for simple smooth scrolling or state changes if navigation requires hiding/showing sections (though for MVP, simple links/display toggles are sufficient).

Featured Project Data Schema (Hardcoded MVP):

For the MVP, the data for the single featured project will be hardcoded within the JavaScript. The expected structure will be a simple JavaScript object:

JavaScript

{
  "title": "string",
  "description": "string", // Supports basic markdown or HTML subset for formatting if needed
  "thumbnailUrl": "string", // URL to the thumbnail image asset
  "videoUrl": "string"      // URL to the video asset (e.g., MP4, or YouTube embed URL if applicable)
}
Project Structure:

The project structure will follow the outline provided in the PRD, emphasizing clear separation of concerns for a static site.

Bash

/creative-builder-portfolio
├── index.html          # Main HTML file defining structure
├── style.css           # Main CSS file for styling
├── script.js           # Main JavaScript file for interactivity and logic
├── /assets             # Directory for static assets
│   ├── /images         # Images (e.g., thumbnail for featured project)
│   ├── /fonts          # Custom fonts if used
│   └── /videos         # Video files for featured project
└── .gitignore          # Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore
Note: As the project grows, script.js may be logically partitioned into smaller files or modules within a /js subdirectory, but for MVP, a single entry point is acceptable.

Patterns and Standards (Opinionated & Specific)
Architectural/Design Patterns:
Client-Side Modularity: Although using a single script.js initially for MVP simplicity, code within it should be organized logically into distinct sections or functions corresponding to components (Canvas, Portfolio Element, Modal logic) to facilitate future splitting into separate modules. Avoid monolithic, unorganized code.
Event Delegation: Where multiple similar interactive elements might exist in the future (though only one portfolio item in MVP), use event delegation to efficiently handle events.
API Design Standards: Not applicable for external APIs in MVP. Internal JavaScript interactions should aim for clear function signatures and minimal global state where possible.
Coding Standards:
Style Guide: Follow the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide.
Formatter: Use Prettier with default settings for automatic code formatting.
Linter: Use ESLint with the Airbnb configuration for identifying and reporting on code patterns.
Naming Conventions: Use camelCase for JavaScript variables and functions. Use PascalCase for JavaScript classes (if introduced). Use kebab-case for CSS classes and file names.
Comments: Add JSDoc comments for functions explaining their purpose, parameters, and return values. Add comments for complex CSS sections or JavaScript logic.
Test Files: While automated testing is out of scope, any manual test notes or planned test cases should ideally be documented in a tests/manual directory outside of the src or main project files.
Error Handling Strategy: Implement basic client-side error handling. Use console.error() to log unexpected errors or issues in the browser console. Avoid try...catch blocks for simple DOM manipulation errors but use them for potentially risky operations (e.g., complex Canvas drawing calculations, loading external resources if added later). Do not display raw technical errors directly to the user; fail gracefully.
CSS Strategy: Use a CSS reset or normalize. Utilize CSS variables for consistent styling (colors, fonts, spacing). Employ Flexbox and Grid for layout rather than older methods like floats.
Initial Project Setup (Manual Steps)
Story 0: Initial Project Set Up and Structure

This epic covers the foundational steps required to get the project started.

Create Project Directory: Manually create a new directory named creative-builder-portfolio.
Bash

mkdir creative-builder-portfolio
cd creative-builder-portfolio
Initialize Git: Initialize a new Git repository in the project root.
Bash

git init
Create Basic Files: Manually create the following essential files in the project root:
index.html
style.css
script.js
.gitignore
Create Assets Directory: Manually create the /assets directory and its subdirectories.
Bash

mkdir assets
mkdir assets/images
mkdir assets/fonts
mkdir assets/videos
Populate .gitignore: Add basic entries to .gitignore to ignore common development files and directories.

Add Boilerplate HTML: Add the basic HTML5 boilerplate to index.html, including the <head> with charset, viewport, title, and links to style.css and script.js (defer attribute recommended for script).
Add Placeholder CSS/JS: Add a simple placeholder comment in style.css and a console.log('script loaded'); in script.js.
Set up Local Development Server: Choose and set up a simple static file server.
Option A (Python): If Python is installed, navigate to the project root in the terminal and run python -m http.server.
Option B (npm): Install live-server globally (npm install -g live-server) and run live-server in the project root.
Decision: Recommend using live-server as it includes live reloading out-of-the-box. Command: npm install -g live-server followed by live-server in the project directory.
Verify Setup: Open the browser to the local server address (usually http://localhost:8080) and verify that the basic HTML page loads, the CSS file is linked (e.g., add a simple body background color in style.css), and the script loaded message appears in the browser console.
Initial Git Commit: Stage all initial files and create the first commit.
Bash

git add .
git commit -m "feat: Initial project setup and boilerplate"
Infrastructure and Deployment
The target deployment environment is a Static Hosting Platform. Given the architecture consists purely of static files (HTML, CSS, JS, images, videos), any service capable of hosting static websites will suffice. Examples include:

GitHub Pages
Vercel
Netlify
AWS S3 configured for static website hosting
Google Cloud Storage configured for static website hosting
The CI/CD strategy for MVP will be manual or basic integration with the chosen hosting platform's features:

Manual Deployment: Upload the project files directly to the hosting service.
Git Integration (Preferred): Connect the Git repository to a service like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages. Configure it to automatically deploy on pushes to the main or master branch.
No specific infrastructure resources beyond standard static file serving are required for the MVP.

Glossary
MVP: Minimum Viable Product. The version of the product with just enough features to satisfy early users and provide feedback for future product development.
PRD: Product Requirements Document. A document outlining the purpose, features, and requirements of a product.
DOM: Document Object Model. A programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.   
FPS: Frames Per Second. A measure of how many unique consecutive images a display can handle every second. Higher FPS generally means smoother animation.
Hardcoded: Data or configuration that is directly written into the source code rather than being loaded from an external source (like a database or API).
Summary of Approved Decisions:

The client-side animation library Motion One will be used.
The interactive Canvas background grid will implement a specific interaction where lines change color on mouse hover/proximity and fade back.
The floating portfolio element's movement will only react to mouse interaction.
The navigation and contact links will be fixed to the bottom-center of the desktop viewport.
The project detail modal for the MVP will include structure to display a thumbnail image and video, in addition to text description.
live-server is the recommended tool for local development.
Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide, Prettier, and ESLint are mandated for coding standards.
Deployment will target a Static Hosting Platform, ideally with Git integration.
