          <p>Ideate started as a way to keep track of story notes during my own meetings. Pitching while trying to log ideas in real time meant a lot of good stuff slipped through the cracks. Existing tools felt like clunky recorders or awkward Zoom bolt-onsâ€”none built for creative flow. I wanted something native to the process: live transcription, speaker tags, and automatic outline generation as I talked. One of my first runs at LLM pipelines with RAG + orchestration. Still a scrappy MVP, but it's already rescued a dozen cold opens from disappearing into the void.</p>
